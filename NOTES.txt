Game:
    Game Starts by Player Choosing the placement of the boats:
        Player will have a choice to Manually Place the Boats or Randomly placed

    Initial GameLoop Starts

    Board will be rendered in the console:
        The Size of the board is randomly generated(between 15 - 50)

    Player will choose the coordinate to shoot:
        Board will mark the specified coordinates and will check it enemy hit or missed:
            HIT = 0
            MISSED = X
        
    Check the Game Board:
        if:
            Hit:
                The Game will mark the part of the boat X and if fully destroyed(all of the parts had been hit) the game will turn their isDead Bool to true and it will be unusable
                if a ship is destroyed the game will null the player's boat array
                
                if:
                    Destroyed:
                        The Game will decrement the current player's current boat count
            Missed:
                The game will just Mark it as X and its unfireable

        else if:
            if the specified coordinates has already been shot then the game will issue a warning and will end the current player's turn
        
        else if:
            All Boats are Destroyed:    
                if All Boats are destroyed from the player then the game will end and the winner will be declared

        the Update function will be called after the game checked the boards


    Updating the Board:
        the board wil reprint but this time it will have the updated board with hits and misses

    End Player Turn 

    Same Semantics for the Opponent From the Player

    Check Game Board again

    Repeat until one side won

    if:
        Won:
            The Game will Abruptly end and the Winner will be anounced

    Fire Function:
        Will Input the coordinates
        after inputting the coordinates a function named checkBoard will appear and it will check the input and update the board

    checkPlayer Function:
        will return true or false

        True:
            if the Boat Count is zero
        False:
            if the Boat Count is more than zero





AI:
    Will Inherit from the player however the Fire function will be overrided and it will input random numbers as athe coordinate
